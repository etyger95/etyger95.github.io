## Research
I am a fifth year PhD student in the Economics department at Stanford University, advised by Al Roth and Mohammad Akbarpour. I am also earning a minor in Computer Science, with the majority of my coursework in ML/AI and CS theory.

My research primarily focuses on complexity in market design and the intersection of economics and computer science. I am particularly interested in the design of mechanisms that are robust to strategic behavior and the study of the computational complexity of mechanism design problems.

I spent the summer of 2023 as an Applied Scientist Intern at Uber, working on the driver pricing team. I spent my time developing a framework to analyze how drivers respond to incentives and information as part of a high-visibility initiative within the organization. It was fascinating to see how the theoretical concepts I study in market design are applied in practice, and I hope to continue working at the intersection of theory and practice in the future.

Prior to my time at Stanford, I was a management consultant at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). I received my BA in Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences and Economics, with minors in Computer Science and Statistics, from Northwestern University in 2018.

## Personal
When I'm not thinking about complexity, you're likely to find me reading a novel. My all-time favorites include *Price and Prejudice* (a classic for a reason!), Iain M. Banks' Culture novels (a fascinating vision of a post-scarcity world), and _The Brothers Karamazov_ (an endless trove of philosophical insights).  Some recent favorites are The Neapolitan Novels by Elena Ferrante and the Expanse series by James S.A. Corey. I am currently devouring the Border trilogy by Cormac McCarthy and inching my way through James Joyce's _Ulysses_. 

Otherwise, I'm likely to be playing music on either the piano or the violin. I have been playing the piano since I was 5, and picked up the violin as an adult (quite a very different learning experience). On the piano, I am currently working on Charles Griffes' _Roman Sketches_, as well as studying jazz theory and improvisation. On the violin, I am working on Edward Elgar's "Salut d'Amour" with the hopes of recording both the violin and piano parts.

If I'm not reading or practicing music, I'm probably keeping up with one of my favorite sports teams. My time in San Francisco has converted me to an avid Giants and Warriors fan. From April to October, there is a good chance I have a baseball game on in the background (Giants, Pirates, or Tigers preferred). However, when it comes to football, I will never abandon my beloved Pittsburgh Steelers #SteelerNation.

If all else fails, I can be found snuggling with my two Italian Greyhounds, Zelda and Thelonious, working on my latest knitting project (my favorite blanket featured is below!).
